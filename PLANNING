Components
 + DalvikVM
   - core.jar, framework.jar, ext.jar
 + Zygote / Launcher
    - Preload Java classes
 + Installer?
 + ...?

System Services
 + Settings
 + Surface flinger?
 + Window Manager?
 + Activity Manager?
 + ...?

I/O
 + Screen       OpenGL
 + touch        Drag events from the window?


Open Questions
 + How does an app get access to the resources in the APK?
       A: installed files in the file system
          - OR - provided by reading the APK directly.
 + How does an app paint on the window?
       A: The application asks for an OpenGL window, gets one (which should be
          embedded into a standard X/Wayland window and handled by the normal
          window manager (kwin).
 + How to communicate between services/apps when there is no kernel bridge?
       A: settings: Over a named pipe
       A: serviceflinger: protocol buffers
 + What do we need to do with the DEX before running it?
       A: not much(?)

----------------------------------------------------------------

Launcher
 + Replacement for Android's Zygote
 + start the VM
 + load the application into the VM
 + load deps of the application
 
Surface Flinger
 + Create a window with an OpenGL canvas/context
 + ...?

----------------------------------------------------------------

Estimations are not definite since we are still learning a lot about how the
Android sources are organized. But right now this is the best estimate.

Development Activities
 + Create Launcher
    - Build the parts from zygote that will be reused   STEP 1: 1 week  (0.5 due July, 24th 2014)
    - Write porting code                                STEP 2: 2 weeks (0.6 due August, 7th 2014)
       . Start VM
       . Load system java classes
       . Load application provided classes
       . Load application
 + Write a Java Native Interface (JNI)                  STEP 3: 2 weeks (0.7 due August, 21st 2014)
    This includes the input from kbd and touch
 + Write "Surface Flinger"                              STEP 4: 1 week  (0.8 due August, 28th 2014)

Goal: Flappy bird flies                                          6 weeks (0.8 due August, 28th 2014)
