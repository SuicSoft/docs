This file describes how to build Shashlik, the simulated Android environment.



Getting the Sources
===================

Shashlik uses Dalvik, the Android runtime interpreter, to run the
applications.  In addition to Dalvik itself we need to have a number of
dependencies from the Google Android source tree to be able to build
it. 

Dalvik is normally built inside the full Android source tree and we want to
minimize the dependency tree when building on a normal Linux system. Here is
the list of sources that are necessary to build Shashlik. For each component
below you should be able to just cut and paste the command lines into a shell.

The source trees should be placed next to each other in a common subdirectory,
e.g. $HOME/SHASHLIK or something similar.  In the rest of this file we will
assume that you are using this location.  If not, you will have to adjust the
instructions below accordingly.

  cd
  mkdir SHASHLIK
  cd SHASHLIK

Create the main directory for the sources. We recommend using a separate
directory for the source tree because you will also have the install directory
at this level (see below under Building the sources).

  mkdir src
  cd src

Then proceed to download the git and svn repositories as follows.  


1. The 5 repositories from the Shashlik project on github.

Shashlik has 4 repos from the Google Android sources copied into Github. These
4 repos are Dalvik, Android Core, Android Libcore and Frameworks Native. The
changes in these repositories will be kept as small as possible so that it will
be easier to upgrade to a later version later. The main code written for Shashlik
is created in the 5th repository of the project named (surprise!) shaslik.

The main page of the project is https://github.com/shashlik. Here you will
find links to all 5 repositories. Since the shashlik repos are private you
will need to give your username and password to clone them.

  git clone https://github.com/shashlik/shashlik.git
  git clone --branch shashlik-kitkat https://github.com/shashlik/dalvik.git
  git clone --branch shashlik-kitkat https://github.com/shashlik/android-core.git
  git clone --branch shashlik-kitkat https://github.com/shashlik/android-libcore.git
  git clone --branch shashlik-kitkat https://github.com/shashlik/android-frameworks-native.git


2. Other Android repositories

Shashlik is also using some other Android repositories but without changing
anything in them.  You need to check these out too. Since we want a stable
point to work from, we use the kitkat-release branch.

  git clone --branch kitkat-release https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base  frameworks-base
  git clone --branch kitkat-release https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/native frameworks-native


3. safe-iop

Safe IOP is also a Google library which is described like this on the project
home page at https://code.google.com/p/safe-iop/:

    "This library provides a collection of (macro-based) functions for
    performing safe integer operations across platform and architecture with a
    straightforward API."

This library is kept in subversion. To check it out, do the following:

  svn checkout http://safe-iop.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ safe-iop
  cd safe-iop
  svn switch http://safe-iop.googlecode.com/svn/tags/r0.3.1

We will use a specific release, in this case 0.3.1, to get a stable platform.
This is the reason for the svn switch.


4. libnativehelper

Libnativehelper is another library from Google which is necessary to build
Dalvik. It contains support functions for Android's class libraries. This one
is kept in git.

  git clone --branch kitkat-release https://android.googlesource.com/platform/libnativehelper

This repository is used without modification, and the master branch is tracked.


5. bionic

Bionic is a derivation of the BSD's standard C library code that was
originally developed by Google for their Android[2] operating system
(Wikipedia). It is a stripped-down version of libc that contains exactly what
is needed on Android. It is necessary to build Dalvik, although there is a
project to port Dalvik to GNU libc.

There is a project called dvk (https://code.google.com/p/dvk/) whose goal is
to port dalvik to other CPU architectures and away from needing bionic but we
have not gone down that route.

  git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic

We use the kitkat tag for this one, meaning you need to run:

  git checkout android-4.4.4_r2.0.1

which will leave you with a detached head


6. skia

Skia is a graphics library used extensively throughout android (and chrome/chromium),
and we specifically need the kitkat tag of it (as above), as the android libraries
depend on changes made to the library.

  git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/skia
  git checkout android-4.4.4_r2.0.1

  -- NOTE: We will need a custom copy of this, as we need the following changes:
    Granted that these are include files, perhaps we can simply store these two locally
  include/core/SkUserConfig.h:46
    -#define SK_BUILD_FOR_ANDROID_FRAMEWORK
    +// #define SK_BUILD_FOR_ANDROID_FRAMEWORK
  include/core/SkUserConfig.h:190
    -#define SK_SFNTLY_SUBSETTER "sample/chromium/font_subsetter.h"
    +// #define SK_SFNTLY_SUBSETTER "sample/chromium/font_subsetter.h"
  include/gpu/GrTypes.h289
    -    #error "Skia gpu currently assumes little endian"
    +//     #error "Skia gpu currently assumes little endian"


7. openssl

openssl is the premiere secure socket layer library used by free software projects,
and android has made certain modifications to it which makes it difficult to simply
use the one provided by most linux distributions. So, we use theit modified version.

  git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/openssl
  git checkout android-4.4.4_r2.0.1

8. ext libraries

A set of java libraries used by android and packed together into one jar.

  git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/nist-sip
  git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/apache-http
  git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/tagsoup
  git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libphonenumber
  git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/okhttp
  git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/bouncycastle

for all of the above:
  git checkout android-4.4.4_r2.0.1

9. jni requirements

  git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/opt/telephony
  git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/opt/net/voip
  git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/hardware/libhardware
  git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/hardware/liblzf
  git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/protobuf
  git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/sqlite
  git checkout android-4.4.4_r2.0.1


Building the Sources
====================

The goal of Shashlik is to create a stand-alone Android runtime
environment. This basically means Dalvik with a number of support features
such as emulated sensors and a screen.

Dalvik itself needs a number of support classes and libraries from other parts
of the Android sources. Unfortunately the dependencies themselves drag in more
dependencies and so on until most of Android is present. It turns out that
Dalvik itself does not use that many classes and functions in the dependency
libraries so by selecting to build only those classes that are actually needed
we can keep down the number of repositories that we need to check out.

In this description we assume that you have downloaded the sources above and
that they are all in $HOME/shashlik. 

At this time the instructions assume that you are building on a standard Linux
desktop system with an installed software development kit. Refer to your
distribution on how to install this. As far as we know there are no
distribution specific problems or peculiarities.


Prerequisites
-------------

Aside from using a normal Linux development system (make, gcc, etc) you need
a variety of components that might not be on everybodys computers:
 - CMake, version 2.8 minimum
 - Qt 5.3
 - KDE Frameworks 5 (KF5)
 - Java SDK version 6
   This is due to the requirement in KitKat for version 6. Newer or older won't
   suffice, it has to be a version 6 (e.g. openjdk's 1.6 sdk).
 - Fontconfig, Freetype, giflib, libjpeg, libwebp, harfbuzz, libGLU

This instruction will from here on assume that you have these installed
correctly.  If not, you will have to install them (probably build yourself)
using their respective installation instructions.

NOTE: Even after installing Qt5.3 and KF5 correctly for normal usage you will
      still have to add a specific environment variable to be able to use them
      for development using CMake:

        export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$KF5:$CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH

We also suggest to create an environment variable with the path of the
Shashlik top directory.

  export SHASHLIK=$HOME/SHASHLIK

In the rest of this document we shall use this variable in our examples.


Branches
--------

We are trying to minimize the changes in each component as much as
possible. However some changes are necessary and cannot be avoided. So for
each dependency that does need to be changed, we have created a branch called
shashlik-kitkat. 

Some of the components have release tags that we are using so that we can have
a stable build.  Here is a list of the branches and tags that we are using. If
you have checked out the repositories using the commands given above they
should be on the correct branch already.

* shashlik:                   branch master
* dalvik:                     branch shashlik-kitkat
* android-core:               branch shashlik-kitkat
* android-libcore:            branch shashlik-kitkat
* android-frameworks-native:  branch shashlik-kitkat

* frameworks-base             branch kitkat-release
* frameworks-native           branch kitkat-release
* safe-iop:                   tag http://safe-iop.googlecode.com/svn/tags/r0.3.1
* libnativehelper:            branch kitkat-release
* bionic:                     tag android-4.4.4_r2.0.1
* skia:                       tag android-4.4.4_r2.0.1
* openssl:                    tag android-4.4.4_r2.0.1

As you can see above, the repo shashlik itself is the one where we try to put
all of our changes so that should be on master branch unless you are working
on some new feature in a feature branch.


Building
--------

Building Shashlik is slightly more complicated than building a normal source
tree. This is because we are taking sources from the Android source tree and
build them in a way that they are not designed for.

You can install anywhere you like, basically, but we highly recommend that you
do so by creating a SHASHLIK/install directory. Note that the install directory
should be _outside_ the shashlik repo source tree but under the SHASHLIK top
directory.

  cd $SHASHLIK
  mkdir install

For building, the procedure is in itself similar to how you normally compile
any other cmake based project, however the directory structure is vital. The
build system expects the location of the sources to be as suggested in Getting
The Sources above. In other words, you should have a directory structure
similar to the following tree. Those marked with * are directories you should
be creating, all the others are git clones (and that one svn checkout):

+ SHASHLIK *
  + install *
  + src *
    + android-core
    + android-frameworks-native
    + android-libcore
    + bionic
    + dalvik
    + frameworks-base
    + libnativehelper
    + safe-iop
    + shashlik
      + build *


Lastly you will have to build the shashlik sources that depend on the selected
Android libraries that were created in the builddeps directory. This is done
in the $SHASHLIK/src/shashlik/build/ directory and it is really easy:

  cd $SHASHLIK/src/shashlik/build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$SHASHLIK/install
  make install

You can now run all the shashlik binaries by adding the install path to your
PATH environment variable:

  export PATH=$SHASHLIK/install/bin:$PATH
